I was born and raised in (Brooklyn, NY)[google maps]. As a result, I know the New York City like the back of my hand. During my high school years, I got to know Massachusetts just as well.  My favourite foods include (salchipapa)[google query], (pizza)[google query], and (grilled chocolate chip muffins)[google query]. 
My story with software started at age 5, when my parents bought our first family computer. Due to my youthful mischievousness, my first programs involved writing simple scripts to break games, and beat my brother in them. Ultimately, as I grew up, this motivation transformed into a desire to help of others. This was first displayed in high school, when I worked on a time-based, protein cascade pathway study, that mapped the various activation pathways that resulted in atherosclerosis. For this study, I performed the in-vitro experiments and wrote a python script to parse, filter, and clean-up multiple datasets consisting of thousands of data points. 
Since then, I would make a hobby of programming small scripts related to IT, like turning a computer on and off remotely with my voice, minimizing and maximizing windows with a button, etc. However when I finished college, I decided to start learning web development and ultimately feel in love with it, even going on to teach my science students at the time, all about it. They all went on to build their own websites by the end of that semester. 
Nowadays, I wish to continue building helpful and impactful projects for others. I especially enjoy those related to education, health, and technology, as I have a deep love for these industries, but as long as the project is challenging, Iâ€™m satisfied.
