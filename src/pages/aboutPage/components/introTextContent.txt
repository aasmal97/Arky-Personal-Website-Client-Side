I was born and raised in (Brooklyn, NY)[google maps]. As a result, I know New York City, like the back of my hand. My favorite foods include (salchipapa)[google query], (pizza)[google query], and (grilled chocolate chip muffins)[google query]. 
My story with technology began at age 5, when my parents bought our first family computer. Due to my youthful mischievousness, I would always find programs that would crack old games, for the sole purpose of beating my brother in them. As I grew up, my interest in technology merged with my desire to help and empower others. This led to my use of Python in high school, to perform image and data analysis on thousands of images and data points respectively. The results were used by researchers to create innovative methods to treat atherosclerosis.
Since then, I've had an incredible passion for building impactful projects. I especially enjoy those related to education, health, and technology, as I have a deep love for these industries, but if the project is challenging, Iâ€™m satisfied.
Currently, I have a strong foundation in front-end development, and have been increasing by backend knowledge over the years. I have worked extensively with a variety of CI/CD tools, databases, and testing libraries, but despite that, I continue to be hungry for more.
However, despite my thirst for knowledge, in the end, I'm only satisfied when I can be part of a team, creating and bringing value to and with others. After all, the best achievements are best celebrated with others.
