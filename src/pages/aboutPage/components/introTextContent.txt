I was born and raised in (Brooklyn, NY)[google maps]. As a result, I know New York City, like the back of my hand. My favorite foods include (salchipapa)[google query], (pizza)[google query], and (grilled chocolate chip muffins)[google query]. 
My story with software started at age 5, when my parents bought our first family computer. Due to my youthful mischievousness, my first programs involved writing simple scripts for games, to beat my brother in them. As I grew up, my interest in technology merged with my desire to help and empower others. For example, in high school, I wrote a Python script to parse, filter, and clean multiple datasets consisting of thousands of data points for a time-based, protein-activation cascade pathway (study)[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31597445/] on the development of atherosclerosis. This research was a big step in developing new treatments for the (leading cause of death, worldwide.)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507799/]
Ever  since, I've had an incredible passion for building impactful projects. I especially enjoy those related to education, health, and technology, as I have a deep love for these industries, but as long as the project is challenging, I’m satisfied.
Currently, I have a strong foundation in front-end development, and have been increasing by backend knowledge over the years. I have worked extensively with a variety of frontend libraries, CI/CD tools, databases, and testing libraries, but despite that, I’m always excited to learn more. After all, I’m a firm believer that life is story of continuous learning. 
However, all my skills mean nothing without an amazing team, and ultimately I am truly fulfilled when I can be part of a collaborative effort, creating and bringing value to and with others. After all, the greatest achievements are those celebrated with and by others.
