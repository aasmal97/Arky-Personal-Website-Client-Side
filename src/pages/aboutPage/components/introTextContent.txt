I was born and raised in (Brooklyn, NY)[google maps]. As a result, I know New York City, like the back of my hand. During my high school years, I also got to know (Massachusetts)[google maps] very well. My favourite foods include (salchipapa)[google query], (pizza)[google query], and (grilled chocolate chip muffins)[google query]. 
My story with software began at age 5, when my parents bought our first family computer. Due to my youthful mischievousness, my first programs involved writing simple scripts that broke games, for the sole purpose of beating my brother in them. Ultimately, as I grew up, my interest in software transformed and merged with my desire to help and empower others. This was first displayed in high school, when I worked on a time-based study, that mapped various activation pathways in a protein cascade pathway, which would result in atherosclerosis. For this study, I performed the in-vitro experiments and wrote a python script to parse, filter, and clean-up multiple datasets consisting of thousands of data points.
After that, programming and software development became a pretty serious hobby of mine. I would write small scripts related to IT, like turning a computer on and off remotely with my voice, controlling window actions with buttons, etc. Then, when I finished college, I decided to start learning web development and fell in love with it. I even taught it to my science students. They all went on to build their own websites by the end of that semester.
Nowadays, I love building helpful and impactful projects. I especially enjoy those related to education, health, and technology, as I have a deep love for these industries, but as long as the project is challenging, Iâ€™m satisfied.
